## Teaching

I lecture Prelims (first year) <a href="https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=4931">Computational Mathematics</a> and <a href="https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=4947">Constructive Mathematics</a>. I think the <a href="https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=54995">lecture notes for Computational Mathematics</a> are a nice introduction to Python for mathematicians; check out the automated derivation of the equations of motion from its Hamiltonian in Chapter 13.

In previous years I lectured the C6.4 Finite Element Methods for PDEs course for Part C (fourth-year), MSc, and DPhil students.
The [video lectures, lecture notes, and lecture slides](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/farrellp/femvideos) are publicly available.
The [Oxford course webpage is here](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/node/4910).

Among other subjects, I tutor Linear Algebra, Geometry, Constructive Mathematics, Differential Equations, Numerical Analysis, and Calculus of Variations for Oriel college.

I have also been lucky to lecture at several summer schools. I prepared <a href="{{site.url}}/files/kacov2023.pdf">some lecture slides on bifurcation analysis</a> for the 2023 KÃ¡cov school.
