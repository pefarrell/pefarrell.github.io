Patrick Farrell is a Professor in the numerical analysis group at the University of Oxford, and (for 2025-2026) the Donatio Universitatis Carolinae Chair in the faculty of mathematics and physics at Charles University in Prague.  His research interests are in the numerical solution of partial differential equations arising in physics and chemistry.

He obtained his bachelor's degree in mathematics from the University of Galway, and his doctorate from Imperial College London in 2010. His doctoral thesis won the Roger Owen prize from the UK Association for Computational Mechanics, and the Janet Watson prize from Imperial.

He has been awarded an EPSRC Early Career Research Fellowship (2013-2018), the 2015 Wilkinson Prize for Numerical Software, second place in the 2015 Leslie Fox Prize in Numerical Analysis, the 2021 Charles Broyden Prize in optimisation, a 2021 Whitehead Prize from the London Mathematical Society, and the 2025 SIAM Germund Dahlquist Prize.

<!--
He has graduated 12 PhD students. They have gone on to win Marie SkÅ‚odowska-Curie, Heilbronn, Dirichlet, Hooke, and INI-Simons fellowships, and permanent positions at Imperial, Charles University, the Basque Center for Applied Mathematics, and the National University of Defense Technology.
