I am an [Associate Professor of Numerical Analysis and Scientific
Computing](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/patrick.farrell) in the
[Numerical Analysis
group](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/numerical-analysis) of the
University of Oxford, and a Tutorial Fellow at [Oriel
College](http://www.oriel.ox.ac.uk/people/dr-patrick-farrell),
Oxford.

I work on the numerical
solution of partial differential equations, with a particular focus on

 - finite element methods,
 - bifurcation analysis of nonlinear PDE,
 - adjoint techniques, their application and automation,
 - preconditioners and fast solvers.

I have applied the numerical techniques I develop to various
applications, in the areas of renewable energy,
cardiac electrophysiology, glaciology, magnetohydrodynamics,
quantum mechanics, and liquid crystals.

I lead the development of
[dolfin-adjoint](https://www.dolfin-adjoint.org) and
[defcon](https://bitbucket.org/pefarrell/defcon), and regularly
commit to [PETSc](https://gitlab.com/petsc/petsc),
[petsc4py](https://bitbucket.org/petsc/petsc4py), and
[firedrake](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/).
